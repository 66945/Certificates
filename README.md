# Download instructions
Once you perform these download instructions, unless the files get deleted or something, you should not need to do them again. Make sure you are using windows.

Step 1: Download python. To do this press the windows key and type in ‘python’ then press enter. If you have python installed, it should bring up a black window. If you do not have it installed, this should bring you to the Microsoft store page for python, where you should press the ‘get’ button. Wait for the program to install. If neither thing happens, email me.

Step 2: Click the ‘Clone or download’ button on the GitHub page.

Step 3: Click ‘Download zip’. Save to whatever folder you like.

Step 4: Go to the download location and extract the zip folder. Make sure all the files in the zip folder end up in a new folder.

Step 5: To run the program, double click the ‘main.py’ file in the new folder you made. If the program closes without opening a webpage, email me.
